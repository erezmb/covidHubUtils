<p>The <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/" class="external-link">COVID-19 Forecast
Hub</a> is a central repository for modeler-contributed short-term
forecasts of COVID-19 trends in the US. The US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) displays forecasts from the Forecast Hub on
its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html" class="external-link">modeling
and forecasting webpages</a>.</p>
<p>The Forecast Hub has been curating forecast data since April 2020,
and has collected over 150 million unique rows of forecast data. These
data are stored in our <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub" class="external-link">public GitHub
repository</a> and in the <a href="https://zoltardata.com/" class="external-link">Zoltar
forecast archive</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the <code>covidHubUtils</code> R package is to create a
set of basic utility functions for accessing, visualizing, and scoring
forecasts from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.</p>

<p>The <code>covidHubUtils</code> package relies on a small number of
packages, including many from the <code>tidyverse</code> and,
importantly, <a href="http://reichlab.io/zoltr/" class="external-link">the <code>zoltr</code>
package</a> that is used to access the Zoltar API for downloading
forecasts. Please install <code>zoltr</code> from GitHub, as this
development version often has important features not yet on the CRAN
version:</p>

<p>The <code>covidHubUtils</code> package currently is only available on
GitHub, and it may be installed using the <code>remotes</code>
package:</p>

</h2>
<p>One of the key features of the COVID-19 Forecast Hub is making
millions of rows of forecast data available in a standard format for
easy analysis and visualization. The <code>covidHubUtils</code> package
allows for users to download data into an R session either by reading
files from a local clone of <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub" class="external-link">the COVID-19
Forecast Hub repository</a> or by downloading data from the Zoltar API.
(While Zoltar currently requires a user account to download data via the
API, we have created a specific user account for
<code>covidHubUtils</code> so that a user account is not needed.)</p>
<p>We have identified two central use cases for downloading data using
<code><a href="../reference/load_forecasts.html">load_forecasts()</a></code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Downloading the “latest” forecasts for selected models that might
be submitted in a short period of time. This is achieved by using
<code>dates</code> and <code>date_window_size</code>
parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Downloading all available forecasts for selected models that are
submitted on a set of dates. This is achieved by using a vector of dates
in <code>dates</code> parameter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are some examples of reading in data. We start by loading the
<code>covidHubUtils</code> package.</p>

<p>The following code loads forecasts from Zoltar for the
COVIDhub-ensemble model. Note that the <code>date_window_size</code>
parameter specifies the range of days to look at for a forecast.
<code>date_window_size</code> will be applied to every date in
<code>dates</code> parameter to create a list of potential forecast
dates to look at. All queries below are looking for the most recent
forecast from COVIDhub-ensemble in the span of 2021-03-02 through
2021-03-08. In this case, for each day in <code>dates</code>,
<code>date_window_size = 6</code> covers a full week, starting from 6
days before a date and going up through the user-provided date. By
default, <code>date_window_size</code> is set to 0 to use all forecast
dates in <code>dates</code> only.</p>
<p>We also provide examples to load incident hospitalization forecasts
and incident death forecasts here by changing <code>targets</code> to
the desired quantity.</p>
<p>The <code>verbose</code> parameter has been explicitly set to
<code>FALSE</code> to prevent output from the internal helper function
in <code><a href="../reference/load_forecasts.html">load_forecasts()</a></code>. It is set to <code>TRUE</code> by
default and all information will be printed in the console.</p>

<p>Some additional arguments in <code><a href="../reference/plot_forecasts.html">plot_forecasts()</a></code> are
helpful for creating a reasonable plot if <code>forecast_data</code> has
multiple locations, forecast dates or models.</p>
<p>The following code looks at three models’ forecasts of incident
deaths at one time point for one location. Note the use of the
<code>fill_by_model</code> option which allows colors to vary by model
and the <code>facet</code> command which is passed to ggplot.</p>

deaths for multiple locations submitted at the same forecast time point.
Note the use of the <code>facet_scales</code> option which is passed to
<code>ggplot</code> and allows the y-axes to be on different scales.</p>

<p>By default <code><a href="../reference/plot_forecasts.html">plot_forecasts()</a></code> uses JHU CSSE data as the
“Observed Data” in the above plots. However, users can specify custom
“ground truth” data that either they provide themselves or that is
loaded in from the package.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a call to <code><a href="../reference/plot_forecasts.html">plot_forecasts()</a></code> that
simply specifies an alternate truth source, which must be one of “JHU”,
“HealthData” or “NYTimes”.</p>

</h2>
<p>In addition to querying forecasts and truth data,
<code>covidHubUtils</code> has the capability to evaluate the forecasts
based on metrics including the prediction interval coverage at any
provided quantiles, the absolute error based on a median estimate, the
weighted interval score (WIS) of the forecast, and a component-wise
breakdown of WIS into dispersion, overprediction and
underprediction.</p>
<p>These scores could be used to compare the accuracy and precision of
forecasts across models, locations, horizons, and submission weeks. You
can access the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21250974v1" class="external-link">evaluation
paper</a> to read an in-depth explanation about the methodologies.</p>
<p>To find the most recent weekly forecast evaluation summary, please

<p>The inputs to the <code>scored_forecasts()</code> include a
<code>forecasts</code> data frame created by
<code><a href="../reference/load_forecasts.html">load_forecasts()</a></code> and a <code>truth</code> data frame
created by <code><a href="../reference/load_truth.html">load_truth()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The <code>scoringutils</code> package provides a collection of
metrics and proper scoring rules that make it simple to score forecasts
against the true observed values.</p>

<p>We use plotting functions from <code>scoringutils</code> to visualize
different scoring metrics.</p>
<p>Heatmaps are a great way to visualize your data over a large number
of models. The following code provides a skeleton for visualizing the
WIS score of multiple models over the 4 horizons:</p>
